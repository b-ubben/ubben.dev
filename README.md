# Ubben.dev
---
A minimal project consisting of an index.html and some
assets compiled nicely and simply
with [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org)

Also makes use of an awesome typing animation library
called [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js)
and [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
